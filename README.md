## About this project

A modern, front-end sneaker shopping app.

This is a solution to the Odin's Project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart) to create a functional shopping cart utilizing browser routing. This site goes a step further and includes product pages, as well as an About page. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
